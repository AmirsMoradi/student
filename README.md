This program allows you to create and analyze the grade distribution of a class of students in a simulated way. The purpose of this program is to be able to generate, analyze and visually display statistical data using Python tools. In the following, I will explain the function and applications of this program in more detail:
Program performance:
Creating synthetic data: Using numpy, the program generates students' grades randomly. These scores are simulated based on the normal (Gaussian) distribution. The normal distribution is found in many real data, especially in student grades, where most students typically have grades close to the mean and fewer have very high or very low grades. In this example, we have generated 100 random grades that average The scores are 70 and the standard deviation is 10.
 This means that most of the scores are in the range of 60 to 80. Statistical analysis of the data: the program calculates the mean, median and standard deviation of the scores: Mean: The average score indicates the center of gravity of the data. The median shows the middle point of the data, so that half of the data are above and half below it. Standard deviation: The standard deviation shows the dispersion of scores compared to the mean. The larger the standard deviation, the more dispersed the students' grades are.
Data visualization:
Histogram chart:
This graph shows how many times each range of scores was repeated. For example, several students scored between 60 and 70. KDE Chart (Kernel Density Estimation): This chart displays a continuous estimate of the distribution of scores. This graph can help us to have a better understanding of the shape of the distribution of scores. Mean and median lines: Lines drawn on the graph that represent the mean and median of scores. These lines help us to know in which area most of the students' scores are.
Applications of the program:
Simulation and data analysis:
 If you need to create data similar to real data, this program can help you. For example, if you need student grade data in a project and this data is not available, you can create synthetic data with this method. Understanding distributions and data dispersion: With this program, you can better understand how grades are distributed. Are the scores evenly distributed around the mean or are there large scatters? Are the scores mostly close to the mean or are they skewed towards very high or low values? Teaching and learning: This program is a practical example of using statistical tools and data visualization in Python.
